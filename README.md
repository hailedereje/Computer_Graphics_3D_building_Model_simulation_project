  **3-D BUILDING MODEL SIMULATION
  
  - this github account includes the source code for building model of our own imagination. 
  - our aim is to show the exterior design of what we call modern 3D building .
  - we have used blender throught the design process upto complation
  - we have used pygame to render the obj file from blender
  
  note: whan it first rendered it shows the object zoomed in by the largest extent. so you can see
  the whole part by zooming out.
  - you can see the detail by zooming in to the direction you want.
  - you can also rotate to the any direction all using by touchpad.
